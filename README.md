### Very simple Backbone with PHP AJAX example  (by no means should be used for anything other than learning)

In this example, any change to the modify date of the target file in the PHP script will trigger the status change on the backbone.html page

This was used to further understanding of Backbone as well as to implement a simple feature in an existing (much larger) Backbone application.
